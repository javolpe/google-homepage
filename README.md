<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>"This is  mini project to deconstruct an exisiting web page.  I am stil having trouble with syntax and remembering exactly where to put spaces, quotes, etc.  The biggest issue so far is remembering all the types of elements and how each one specifically works.  I am not sure exactly what this current project is but I'm excited to actually build some shit and see what basic things I can do."</p>
